An English text needs to be encrypted using the following encryption scheme: 
First, the spaces are removed from the text. Let L be the length of this text. 
Then, characters are written into a grid, whose rows and columns have the following constraints:

floor(sqrt(L)) <= row <= column < ceil(sqrt(L))

Example: 
s = "if man was meant to stay on the ground god would have given us roots"
After removing spaces, the string is 54 characters long. sqrt(54) is between 7 and 8 so it’s written in the form of a grid with 7 rows and 8 columns.

ifmanwas  
meanttos          
tayonthe  
groundgo  
dwouldha  
vegivenu  
sroots

Ensure that rows * columns >= L. 
If multiple grids satisfy above conditions, choose one with minimum area i.e., rows * columns.

The encoded message is obtained by displaying the characters of each column, with a space between column texts. The encoded message for the grid above is:

Create a function to encode a message.
